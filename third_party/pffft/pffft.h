   PFFFT : a Pretty Fast FFT.

   This is basically an adaptation of the single precision fftpack
   (v4) as found on netlib taking advantage of SIMD instruction found
   on cpus such as intel x86 (SSE1), powerpc (Altivec), and arm (NEON).

   For architectures where no SIMD instruction is available, the code
   falls back to a scalar version.

   Restrictions:

   - 1D transforms only, with 32-bit single precision.

   - supports only transforms for inputs of length N of the form
   N=(2^a)*(3^b)*(5^c), a >= 5, b >=0, c >= 0 (32, 48, 64, 96, 128,
   144, 160, etc are all acceptable lengths). Performance is best for
   128<=N<=8192.

   - all (float*) pointers in the functions below are expected to
   have an "simd-compatible" alignment, that is 16 bytes on x86 and
   powerpc CPUs.

   You can allocate such buffers with the functions
   pffft_aligned_malloc / pffft_aligned_free (or with stuff like
   posix_memalign..)
